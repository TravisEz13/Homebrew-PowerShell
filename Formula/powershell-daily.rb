  def install
    libexec.install Dir["*"]
    chmod 0555, libexec/"pwsh"
    bin.install_symlink libexec/"pwsh" => "pwsh-daily"
  end

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      The executable should already be on PATH so run with `pwsh-daily`. If not, the full path to the executable is:
        #{bin}/pwsh-daily

      Other application files were installed at:
        #{libexec}

      If you also have the Cask installed, you need to run the following to make the formula your default install:
        brew link --overwrite powershell-preview

      If you would like to make PowerShell you shell, run
        sudo echo '#{bin}/pwsh-daily' >> /etc/shells
        chsh -s #{bin}/pwsh-daily
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_equal "7.1.0-daily.20200429",
      shell_output("#{bin}/pwsh-daily -c '$psversiontable.psversion.tostring()'").strip
  end
end
